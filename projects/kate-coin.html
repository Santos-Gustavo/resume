            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>The Kate Coin is a digital coin (e-money token), which is based on blockchain technology and was
                developed entirely within KBC.
                Soon, private KBC customers will be able to acquire Kate Coins and effectively use them via their Kate
                Coin wallet in KBC Mobile.
                This takes place in a so-called "closed loop" environment, a closed environment outside of which the
                Kate Coin has no value.
                First of all within the KBC banking and insurance environment, but in time a whole world of application
                possibilities will open up in the wider ecosystem.
                Indeed, some KBC enterprise customers, third parties or partners who already offer their services via
                KBC Mobile and its 1.8 million users have developed their own ecosystem.
                They could also offer the Kate Coins and, together with KBC, further diversify and grow their business.

            <h3>My tasks</h3>
            <p>As a Data Engineer, my primary tasks were to create a Datalake, pipelines, repository, DataStore, and
                ensure they functioned smoothly in production. Here are the technical details of the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created at least 15 out of 18 pipelines, using technical skills and experience in Python, Spark,
                    SQL, Linux, Workflow Orchestration, Hadoop, Data Governance, GDPR, Agile, and SaFe.</li>
                <li>Developed common functions used by all pipelines, reducing the development time and improving
                    maintainability.</li>
                <li>Continuously improved the readability and efficiency of the pipelines over time, resulting in a more
                    streamlined and optimized workflow.</li>
                <li>Implemented a DataStore for files such as Indivisum, ProgrammableMoney, and PreferredAccount, which
                    were previously calculated in every pipeline. The abstraction and optimization reduced the
                    calculation time in each pipeline and increased the workflow efficiency by over 120%.</li>
                <li>Adhered to best practices in Data Governance, GDPR, Agile, and SaFe, ensuring the project was stable
                    and reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through my technical expertise and experience in Data Engineering, I delivered a faster, more efficient,
                and maintainable data infrastructure that met the client's needs.</p>
