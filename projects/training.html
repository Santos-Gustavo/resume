            <h1>Data Engineering Training Program</h1>
            <p>2021-2023</p>
            </a>

            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>As a Data Engineer, I was responsible for designing and delivering a comprehensive training program
                for new Data engineers and Data analysts
            </p>

            <h3>My tasks</h3>
            <p>The program was aimed at providing the new hires
                with the necessary skills and knowledge to design, develop, and maintain data pipelines and
                infrastructure, and contribute to the company's data-driven culture. Here are the tasks and
                responsibilities I undertook during the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including HR, Learning and Development, and the Technical
                    Leadership team, to define the program's objectives, curriculum, and learning outcomes, and align
                    them with the company's strategic goals and values.</li>
                <li>Delivered the training sessions in-person and remotely, using various formats, such as
                    classroom-style lectures, group discussions, one-on-one coaching, to accommodate
                    different learning styles and preferences.</li>
                <li>Evaluated the trainees' progress and performance, using a variety of methods,
                    code reviews, and peer feedback, and provided timely and constructive feedback to help
                    them improve their skills and knowledge.</li>
                <li>Provided mentorship and guidance to the trainees, offering them the necessary support and resources
                    to help them succeed in their roles, and answer their questions and concerns about the program and
                    the company's data infrastructure and processes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through my experience and expertise as a Data Engineer and educator, I delivered a comprehensive and
                impactful training program that prepared the new Data Engineers to contribute to the company's
                data-driven culture and achieve their career goals. The program's success was reflected in the trainees'
                feedback, their performance in their roles, and the positive impact on the company's data infrastructure
                and processes. </p>
