            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>KBC Mobile is a perfect and efficient banking app for everyday needs and one of the most innovative
                with some interesting extras.

        <h3>My tasks</h3>
        <p>As a Data Engineer, my primary responsibility was to design, develop and implement a batch data
            ingestion pipeline, which processes large volumes of data and delivers near-real-time analytics for a
            leading banking company. Here are the tasks and responsibilities I undertook during the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gathered requirements from the client and collaborated with cross-functional teams to understand the
                business goals and data sources.</li>
            <li>Designed and architected the data pipeline using modern technologies and best practices, such as
                Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Apache Avro, to ensure high throughput, low latency, and
                fault-tolerance.</li>
            <li>Implemented automated testing, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to ensure data accuracy, quality,
                and availability, and maintained the pipeline performance and uptime using tools like Jenkins,
                Linux..</li>
            <li>Deployed the pipeline in a distributed environment, and integrated it with other systems, such as a
                data lake in Hadoop, a dashboarding
                tool in Azure, and a machine learning platform.</li>
            <li>Implemented data governance policies and procedures, including GDPR compliance, and ensured data
                security and privacy.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented a workflow orchestration system to manage the
                pipeline's dependencies with tools similar to AWS Glue and Azure Data Factory, schedule, and
                execution, and track its progress and performance metrics.
            </li>
            <li>Documented the pipeline architecture, data flow, and technical specifications, and provided training
                and support to the client's data team and stakeholders using Agile and SAFe methodologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through my technical expertise and experience in Data Engineering, I delivered a robust and scalable
            data ingestion pipeline that enabled the client to gain valuable insights into customer
            behavior, product trends, and marketing campaigns, and improved their business decisions and outcomes.
