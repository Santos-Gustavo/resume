            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>Our 3 most critical files were legacy code, poorly written and with inaccurate analysis</p>

            <h3>My tasks</h3>
            <p>As a Data Engineer, I re-engineered one of our critical files that contained exclusion attributes. My
                main objective was to create a faster, well-documented, and easy-to-understand codebase that could be
                easily shared and maintained. Here are some of the technical aspects of the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed an efficient and abstract framework that all three exclusion tables in our system now use.
                </li>
                <li>Developed consistent and efficient tests that cover the majority of the cases, reducing the
                    likelihood of regression errors.</li>
                <li>Cleaned the code from 3000 unshareable lines to 42, reducing complexity and making it easy to read
                    and maintain.</li>
                <li>Re-architected the system, reducing the number of files read from 17 to 6, improving performance and
                    efficiency.</li>
                <li>Decreased the pipeline's running time by 75%, and other pipelines that adopted my framework saw
                    their running times reducing by around 50%.</li>
                <li>Utilized technical skills and experience in Python, Spark, SQL, Linux, Workflow Orchestration,
                    Hadoop, Data Governance, GDPR, Agile, and SaFe to deliver the project.</li>
                <li>Adhered to best practices in Data Governance, GDPR, Agile, and SaFe, making the project more stable
                    and reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through my technical skills, experience, and expertise in Data Engineering, I delivered a faster, more
                efficient, and maintainable codebase for the Exclusion Attributes project.</p>
