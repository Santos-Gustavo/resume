              Took over a program with no clear business requirements, processes, documentation or stable team.
              Introduced documentation standards, designed and aligned cross-department business processes, and
              built a realistic roadmap with regular communication and deliveries. Secured support to scale
              data governance and IT into a two-product program of ~15 people, turning a stalled project into
              an organised, owned, priority-one initiative reducing firefighting around critical risk reporting 
              and giving leadership a single, trusted view.

              As part of a CEO-led effort to change how the company operates (with the C-HR as pilot model), helped
              shape and drive the migration of processing pipelines and data warehouses to Snowflake. This created a
              shared, governed data foundation across departments, where we could apply governance, track key metrics,
              and execute against a clear roadmap instead of each initiative reinventing its own data solution.

        <h2 class="section__title">How I think about data &amp; teams</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle">
        <i>A data team is a product in itself – with clear owners, SLAs, and a roadmap, not a ticket factory.</i>
      </p>
        
        <div class="principles-grid">

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>Data platforms should be boring in production.</strong>
            The interesting part should be the insights and products, not nightly firefighting.
            Stability and predictability come first.
          </div>

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>Governance is a speed enabler, not bureaucracy.</strong>
            Clear rules, metadata, and ownership let teams move safely and independently
            instead of slowing them down.
          </div>

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>Documentation and contracts matter more than tools.</strong>
            Good documentation, clear SLAs, and data contracts between teams prevent more
            incidents than any single technology choice.
          </div>

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>Growing people grows the platform.</strong>
            Mentoring engineers, setting standards, and giving them ownership is how
            the whole data function becomes stronger over time.
          </div>

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>If we do it twice, we automate it.</strong>
            Repeated manual work is a design bug. Automation is how you scale without
            burning people out.
          </div>

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>Clear ownership is non-negotiable.</strong>
            Every dataset, pipeline, and decision needs an accountable owner; otherwise,
            quality and reliability degrade quickly.
          </div>

          <div class="principle-item">
            <strong>Processes must be clear, owned, and alive.</strong>
            From business request to BI dashboard, the flow should be explicit,
            agreed by stakeholders, and treated as a living system we continuously improve.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="principles-footer">
          <strong>What I hold myself accountable for:</strong>
          Clear strategy, predictable delivery, a downward trend in incidents and escalations, 
          a healthy team that people want to join, and the ability to explain what’s going on 
          in three slides to a non-technical executive.

        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>Where data can really hurt the business:</strong>
            the products, processes or reports that cause real damage if data is wrong, late, or missing.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>Which flows are fragile and who owns them (or doesn’t):</strong>
            the pipelines, models, or systems everyone fears touching, and whether anyone is truly accountable.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>How much firefighting is normalised:</strong>
            where people are doing “hero work” and treating incidents as routine instead of signals.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>How teams actually work vs slide decks:</strong>
            how requests come in, how priorities are set, and how “done” is defined in reality.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>Where minimal governance &amp; documentation would unlock speed:</strong>
            the smallest set of rules and docs that would reduce friction and hand-offs.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>Team health and skills:</strong>
            who is overloaded, who is underused, and what can realistically be taken on without burning people out.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            <strong>What leadership really expects from data:</strong>
            how executives talk about data, what they think is possible, and where expectations and reality diverge.
